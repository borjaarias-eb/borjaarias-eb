- 👋 Hi, I’m Borja Arias
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Reading (especially fantasy but anything, really), and Sports (I used to practice Basketball, and now I hike, climb, run, and all the 30+ sports 😂)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin, Python, AWS, Creative Writing, probably some language.
- 📫 How to reach me Slack, email.
- 😄 Pronouns: 🤷‍♂️
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know three languages and I have studied 4 more for some time (Arabic 3 years (A2), German 1 year (A1), French 1 year soooo long ago, Japanese self-study a long time ago)
